    Basic Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe
Introduction
The Basic Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe project is a simple smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to create and participate in games of Tic-Tac-Toe. The contract allows players to play the classic game in a decentralized and on-chain environment. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, the project ensures that each game is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.

Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a basic on-chain implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, using the power of the Aptos blockchain. This serves as a foundational starting point for creating more complex multiplayer games in a decentralized environment.

While the current implementation is simple, it showcases the potential of building fully decentralized and interactive gaming experiences on blockchain technology.

Future Goals
The future development of the project aims to extend its capabilities and improve the user experience. Some of the key goals for future updates include:

Game History Tracking: Implement a feature that allows players to view past games, providing a historical record of game outcomes and player statistics.
Multi-player Support: Expand the game to support more than two players, allowing for a more dynamic gaming experience.
Front-end Interface: Develop a user-friendly front-end interface, enabling non-technical users to interact with the game without needing to understand the underlying blockchain technology.
Enhanced Game Features: Add features like player matchmaking, chat functionality, and real-time updates to improve the overall experience.

How to Play
Deploy the contract using the Aptos CLI or any Aptos-compatible tool.
Call the functions within the contract to create a new game, join an existing game, or make moves on the game board.
Players alternate turns, placing their respective marks (X or O) on the board.
Once a player wins, the game is concluded, and the result is stored on the blockchain for verification.
