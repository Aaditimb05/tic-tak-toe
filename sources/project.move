Here is a basic implementation of a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game, using the provided code as a reference:


Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe
Click to open code
This implementation includes the following key features:

A TicTacToeGame struct to represent the game state, including the current board, the current player, and the sets of positions occupied by each player.
A new() function to initialize a new game.
A check_winner() function to determine if a player has won the game by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
A make_move() function to allow players to make moves on the board, updating the game state accordingly.
The example usage at the end demonstrates how the game can be played by making moves and checking the winner.

Prompt: write me a simple move aptos smart contract that should contain 2 functions only on the given idea and the smart contract should be within 40~50 lines.

Basic multiplayer game: TicTacToe

 Take the Reference of the following code as a reference, 
module MyModule::Crowdfunding {
    use aptos_framework::signer;
    use aptos_framework::coin;
    use aptos_framework::aptos_coin::AptosCoin;
    /// Struct representing a crowdfunding project.
    struct Project has store, key {
        total_funds: u64,  // Total tokens raised for the project
        goal: u64,         // Funding goal of the project
    }
    /// Function to create a new project with a funding goal.
    public fun create_project(owner: &signer, goal: u64) {
        let project = Project {
            total_funds: 0,
            goal,
        };
        move_to(owner, project);
    }
    /// Function for users to support the project by contributing tokens.
    public fun contribute_to_project(contributor: &signer, project_owner: address, amount: u64) acquires Project {
        let project = borrow_global_mut<Project>(project_owner);
        // Transfer the contribution from the contributor to the project owner
        let contribution = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(contributor, amount);
        coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(project_owner, contribution);
        // Update the total funds raised
        project.total_funds = project.total_funds + amount;
    }

Points to Note 1. There might be some error that the code can generate while using the GPT. 2. The program might compile but the behavior of the program might not be similar as it should work. 3. Use GPT to make the basic structure of the program. 4. GPT can only generate code around 50~60 lines of code after this point there might be issues that are not solvable.


Here is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe smart contract in Aptos Move that contains two functions:


Tic-Tac-Toe Smart Contract
Click to open code
This contract has the following key features:

The Board struct represents the state of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, including the current state of the cells and the player whose turn it is.
The create_game function allows a player to create a new game by initializing a new Board resource and storing it in their account.
The make_move function allows a player to make a move on the game board, updating the Board resource accordingly.
The contract is designed to be within the 40-50 line requirement, while providing the basic functionality for a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Tic-Tac-Toe Smart Contract
Introduction
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to create and play Tic-Tac-Toe games on the Aptos network.

Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a basic, on-chain implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This can serve as a starting point for building more complex on-chain multiplayer games on the Aptos blockchain.

Future Goals
Implement game history tracking to allow users to view past games
Add support for more than two players
Develop a front-end interface for an enhanced user experience
Deployed Address
The contract is deployed at the following address:
0x422d832a7a3eca12ec3b00b1e5adf51698dc7f479b9bb1a09b9341934789c7f8
